    "Gentrification has become a highly controversial process that gained recognition in the 1960s. Several policies, such as the Ellis Act, have been enforced in California and are considered to impact the rates of gentrification. Since 1985, the Ellis Act has allowed landlords to evict tenants to remove their buildings from the rental market. [<sup>1</sup>](https://nextcity.org/history-of-gentrification) Landlords are still allowed to re-enter their buildings into the rental market; they must keep the same rent as the previous rent for five years. Landlords are later allowed to be rented at market rate, resetting rent-controlled units. This process stimulates a decrease in affordable housing market by removing rent-controlled units from the market. Removing these units accelerates gentrification within these neighborhoods by creating housing attainable for wealthier tenants while simultaneously displacing those native to the region. This law has contributed to the 27,000 rent-controlled units removed since 2001 in Los Angeles. [<sup>2</sup>](https://la.myneighborhooddata.org/2022/12/ellis-act-evictions/)\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is gentrification? Gentrification is the process by which a lower-income neighborhood begins inhabiting higher-income residents, leading to a more exclusive neighborhood. [<sup>1</sup>](https://nextcity.org/history-of-gentrification) Gentrification leads to an increase of new businesses, and improved housing and infrastructure; however, this influx may lead to the displacement of existing residents. For this project, we plan to analyze which cities in these specified counties have undergone gentrification and how this will continue to impact the economic outlook of these cities through home values and median household income.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database created by the Urban Displacement Project depicts a map of all Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties based on gentrification and displacement trends. These trends are based on data from the American Community Survey through the years 1990 and 2015. The database differentiates each city within counties between three specific types: disadvantaged, gentrified, and exclusive neighborhoods. These types were based on changes in property values, median-income households, and college-educated residents. Between 1990 and 2015, there was a 16 percent increase in gentrified areas within Los Angeles, while San Diego County had an 18 percent increase.

    "- Dataset #1\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This dataset is a comprehensive record of housing activity, to the neighborhood level, throughout the United States. This contains an extensive and thorough record of housing prices, listing behaviors and market dynamics, from 2012 to 2024.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Key Variables:\n",
    "  - Median sale price ('median_sale_price'): This represents the middle value of a home sale price within a given neighborhood, within a designated time period, delimited by the Time period variables. We can use this variable to track and analyze, the shifts in the costs of  a local housing market. With this data we intend to perform a thorough analyzsis of housing price trends in the designated metro areas for our research, where a positive increase trend over time, could be an indicator for gentrification.\n",
    "  - Time period ('period_begin, 'period_end'): These variables set the timeframe for a given data entry and the data tracked within this time period, these time periods span throughout a three month period. This variable will be useful for our research, since it will allow us to determine long term market trends for our research and allow us to analyze and compare, price differences within the same neighborhood over the twelve year period of time.\n",
    "  - Location ('region', 'parent_metro_region', 'state', 'city'): These variables determine in which area these data entry is relevant for, where the 'region' variable is the format of \"'city', 'State' - 'Neighborhood name'\". Therefore in order to extract the neighborhood name for each data entry we will have to clean the aformentioned variable to meet our needs. On the other hand the other location variables, describe the county, state and city in which the entry is located. This data will allow us to filter out the dataset in order to focus on the target counties of our research. \n",
    "  - Listing and market behaviors: These variables track information such as the median time a listing stays on the market as well as the average change in price from listing price to sale price, and a whole plethora of other information about the market and listing behavior which was determined to be irrelevant for the purpose of our research, as such it is in our intention to filter this information out, in order to drastically decrease the data load of this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For this dataset, we have the intention to refine it and with it be able to analyze gentrification trends, by observing how the median sale prices have shifted throughout time in the neighborhoods in the counties that are target in our investigation. Through proper filtering and cleaning we will be able to find market treds which may be in correlation to socioeconomic changes in our target regions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Dataset #2\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This dataset is a refined and optimized version of neighborhood_market_tracker.tsv, focusing on the counties of San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles. This data cleaning process involved a number of key steps:\n",
    "  - Filtering for target metro areas: This dataset only includes neighborhoods found within the boundaries of the San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles, counties. This targets the dataset to focus on our target regions for our research.\n",
    "  - Sorting data for consistency:\n",
    "    - Neighborhoods are sorted alphabetically, for ease of retrieval.\n",
    "    - Within each neighborhood, data entries are forted chronologically, to simplify time series analysis.\n",
    "  - Handling redundancies:\n",
    "    - In some instances, through data exploration, it was observed that for some neighborhoods there were multiple consecutive entries where median_sale_price remained unchanged. In light of this, it was decided that for the sake of data efficiency, for these instances consecutive entries with identical data, would be merged in order to ensure a concise and manageable dataset, without losing valuable information for our research.\n",
    "  - Extracting neighborhood names: As was mentioned beforehand, the region variable in the neighborhood_market_tracker.tsv dataset is in the format \"'city', 'State' - 'Neighborhood name'\", since we desired for our research to make neighborhood level analysis, it was decided that for ease of understanding we would splice this variable in order to extract the neighborhood name and preserve it as the neighborhood variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Key variables:\n",
    "  - Median sale price ('median_sale_price'): This represents the middle value of a home sale price within a given neighborhood, within a designated time period, delimited by the Time period variables.

With this data we intend to perform a thorough analyzsis of housing price trends in the designated metro areas for our research, where a positive increase trend over time, could be an indicator for gentrification.\n",

    "  - Location ('neighborhood', 'county', 'state', 'city'): These variables determine in which area these data entry is relevant for. These varaibles, describe the neighborhood, county, state and city in which the entry is located. This data allows us to analyze the trends of median sale prices in a given neighborhood, in order for us to determine if there is a trend of gentrification in the aformentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "  This cleaned dataset provides us a more efficient and structed source for us to conduct our analysis of localized housing value trends, Byeliminating redundant entries we also ensure to steamline the processing while preserving all essential data, in regards to the price trends in our target markets. By refining this dataset, we have improved its usability in tracking beighborhood level gentrification in an efficient manner, while preserving completeness and accuracy."
