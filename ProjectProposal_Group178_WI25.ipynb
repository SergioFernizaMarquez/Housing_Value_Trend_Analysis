    "Gentrification has become a highly controversial process that gained recognition in the 1960s. Several policies, such as the Ellis Act, have been enforced in California and are considered to impact the rates of gentrification. Since 1985, the Ellis Act has allowed landlords to evict tenants to remove their buildings from the rental market. [<sup>1</sup>](https://nextcity.org/history-of-gentrification) Landlords are still allowed to re-enter their buildings into the rental market; they must keep the same rent as the previous rent for five years. Landlords are later allowed to be rented at market rate, resetting rent-controlled units. This law has contributed to the 27,000 rent-controlled units removed since 2001 in Los Angeles. [<sup>2</sup>](https://la.myneighborhooddata.org/2022/12/ellis-act-evictions/) But what is gentrification? Gentrification is the process by which a lower-income neighborhood increases in value due to the rapid growth of wealthy residents. [<sup>1</sup>](https://nextcity.org/history-of-gentrification) Gentrification can increase new businesses and improve housing; however, this influx may lead to the displacement of existing residents. For this project, we plan to analyze which cities in these specified counties have undergone gentrification and how this will continue to impact the economic outlook of these cities through home values and median household income.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database created by the Urban Displacement Project depicts a map of all Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties based on gentrification and displacement trends. These trends are based on data from the American Community Survey through the years 1990 and 2015. The database differentiates each city within counties between three specific types: disadvantaged, gentrified, and exclusive neighborhoods. These types were based on changes in property values, median-income households, and college-educated residents. Between 1990 and 2015, there was a 16 percent increase in gentrified areas within Los Angeles, while San Diego County had an 18 percent increase.

    "1. The ideal dataset for this project would a dataset that tracks median sales data for neighborhoods or zipcodes over substantial period of time, ideally around a decade, within the focus counties of our research. Ideally this data would be stored in a csv or similar format, otherwise a pdf file for easier access and data cleaning work. The ideal variables for such a dataset would be tracking the median or average sale price for the housing in a particular area and having a substantial quantity over a long period of time. Such would be useful in order to track the nature of price increases of housing values over time, not only to track the raw price increase but also consider percent increases over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Redfin US housing market database provides a massive database for tracking housing market data, from median pricing to average time a house sits on the market. This database provides data from 2012 till the present day, going from the national, metro, state, county, city, zipcode and neighborhood level. For our research we would use the neighborhood level tracker, however this is a very large file (over 7 gigabytes) so it will require extensive cleaning untill it can be used in our project."

Yelp and Google Maps might show more businesses that cater to wealthier customers, which can leave other companies less visible.\n",
    "- Data Gaps: If we don't have details on income or race, we might overlook the communities most affected by gentrification.\n",
